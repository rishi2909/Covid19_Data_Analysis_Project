 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Advanced Visualization** of global COVID-19 data using Python.

It is structured in two phases:
1.  **Basic EDA** â€” using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
2.  **Advanced Analytics & Visualizations** â€” using `Plotly`, `Bokeh`, and `Scikit-learn`

##  Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes COVID-19 statistics such as:
- Confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Recoveries
- Active cases
- Observation dates
- Country/Region

ðŸ“Œ *Note: This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle]

---

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` â€” data wrangling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€” static visualizations
- `plotly.express` â€” interactive bar/scatter plots
- `bokeh` â€” dynamic plotting (recovered vs deaths)
- `sklearn` â€” clustering (KMeans)

---

##  Key Visualizations

- Top 10 countries by confirmed cases (bar chart)
- Daily global confirmed trends (line plot)
- Deaths vs Recoveries (pie chart)
- Correlation heatmap between variables
- Interactive plots with Plotly & Bokeh
- KMeans clustering of countries by impact

---

##  Key Insights

- USA, India, and Brazil showed the highest total confirmed cases.
- Recovery rates improved significantly post-2021.
- Strong positive correlation between confirmed cases and deaths.
